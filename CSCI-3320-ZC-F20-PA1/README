/>  Assignment PA1 requires modifying Algorithm 2, 3 & 4 from the text book so that they return in the value
/>> of the maximum subsequence and the starting and ending indices of the maximum subsequence.

/>  The algorithm should take input size (N) from the user and generate a random sequence of N integers
/>> ranging from -9999 to 9999. If N is less than 50, your program must print the randomly generated numbers,
/>> and find the maximum subsequence. The program should measure (print) the execution time of these algorithms
/>> (Algorithm 2, 3 & 4) in milliseconds (ms) or nanoseconds (ns). [Note: 1 second = 103 ms = 109 ns.]
